# Pydantic Model Knowledge Transfer Session

## Session Overview

A 90-minute workshop to introduce the team to Taskra's Pydantic model system and best practices.

## Objectives

By the end of this session, participants will be able to:

1. Explain the benefits and structure of Taskra's Pydantic model system
2. Create and work with models following our project standards
3. Apply best practices for performance and maintainability
4. Use the model adapter system for backward compatibility
5. Test code that uses Pydantic models

## Session Plan

### 1. Introduction (15 minutes)

- Project background and motivation for the migration
- Key benefits of Pydantic models vs dictionaries
- Overview of model structure and inheritance
- Q&A

### 2. Hands-on: Model Usage (25 minutes)

- Creating and using models
- Field types and validation
- Working with nested models
- Factory methods and utility functions

**Exercise**: Create a Comment model with validation and use it

### 3. Adapters and Compatibility (20 minutes)

- Introduction to adapter pattern
- Overview of our adapter functions
- When and how to use adapters
- Converting between models and dictionaries

**Exercise**: Create a custom adapter for a specific use case

### 4. Testing with Models (15 minutes)

- Creating model fixtures
- Mocking services that return models
- Testing validation and serialization
- Common testing patterns

**Exercise**: Write a test for the Comment model

### 5. Performance Best Practices (10 minutes)

- Model creation performance
- Serialization efficiency
- Memory optimization
- Validation strategies

### 6. Q&A and Next Steps (5 minutes)

- Open forum for questions
- Resources for further learning
- Next steps in the migration process
