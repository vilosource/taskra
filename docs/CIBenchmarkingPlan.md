# CI Benchmarking Plan

This document outlines the plan for integrating performance benchmarks into the continuous integration pipeline.

## Goals

1. Automatically run benchmarks on every significant change
2. Track performance metrics over time
3. Alert on significant performance regressions
4. Provide easy access to historical benchmark data

## Metrics to Track

1. **Core Operations**:
   - Model creation time
   - Field access time
   - Serialization time
   - Validation time
   
2. **Memory Usage**:
   - Memory footprint of key operations
   - Object count in typical workflows

3. **API Performance**:
   - Response times for key API endpoints
   - Throughput under load

## CI Integration Steps

### 1. Benchmark Runner Setup

- Create a dedicated runner with consistent hardware
- Set up isolation to ensure reliable results
- Configure environment variables for benchmarking mode

### 2. Benchmark Job Configuration

```yaml
# Benchmark job example
benchmark:
  stage: performance
  only:
    - main
    - merge_requests
  script:
    - python scripts/run_benchmarks.py --output ci_benchmark_results
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - ci_benchmark_results/
```

### 3. Results Processing

- Store benchmark results in a persistent database
- Generate comparison against baseline (main branch)
- Calculate statistical significance of changes

### 4. Reporting

- Generate visual reports with charts
- Add performance change summary to PR comments
- Send alerts for significant regressions

## Baseline Establishment

Before fully automating in CI:

1. Run benchmarks 10+ times to establish variance
2. Set thresholds based on standard deviations
3. Create initial baseline for main branch
4. Document normal variance ranges

## Performance Budget

| Metric | Budget |
|--------|--------|
| Model Creation | ≤ 0.5ms |
| Field Access | ≤ 0.01ms |
| API Response | ≤ 200ms |
| Memory Per Model | ≤ 2KB |

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Week 1**: Set up benchmark runner script
2. **Week 2**: Configure CI job and result storage
3. **Week 3**: Implement comparison and reporting
4. **Week 4**: Establish baselines and thresholds
5. **Week 5**: Roll out to all team members
